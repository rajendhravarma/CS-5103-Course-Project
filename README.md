Date Time Transformation: In this project we are writing a program to transform the given datetime string to different formats.
Filenames:
project.py: This file transforms the given timedate format to user mentioned/choice timedate format which can be EST, MST, PST.
testcases.py: This file contains the test cases for the project.py file. 

Test cases are : 
1. valid o/p, 
2. Invalid time zone, 
3. Invalid hours format, 
4. Invalid date format, 
5. Invalid format all zeros.

Running the program in VScode:
Download the project.py and the testcases.py.
Run the file project.py by giving the command python project.py. Once the program is ran, you will be asked to enter the input of the datetime string(Follow the format that was mentioned while giving the input). By default the input given by the user is taken as CST format. Then User will be asked to enter the expected Outtime format. Then based on the user choice of format, the O/P is generated in the desired format.
